                <h2>Problem Solver</h2>
                <p>I helped people a lot solving their problems. I spent my own time, money and efforts to do such
                    things.
                    But, no one paid me a penny to survive. Now I am wise enough to think of myself. To better
                    position
                    my
                    career, I decided to become a Web Developer. I will not stop until I reach my destination.</p>

                <p>I already learned the basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I can build any simple website. Now, I am
                    learning to build slightly more complex websites and even webapps. My goal is to build more advanced
                    websites and learn advanced topics regarding this technology.</p>

                <p>When I was a student of Prgramming Hero, they didn't like to give me a job. But, I was not unhappy
                    about that. I myself made a website of their institute, and showed it to them. They liked it. Thus I
                    became an independent Web Developer.</p>
